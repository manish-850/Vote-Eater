# Vote Eater

A simple Snake Game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with
support for **keyboard controls** and **touch swipe controls** for
mobile devices.

## Features

-   Classic Snake movement (up, down, left, right)
-   Collision detection (walls and self)
-   Random food generation
-   Score system
-   Game Over screen
-   Mobile swipe support

## How It Works

-   The game board is generated based on available screen area.
-   Snake moves using a fixed interval game loop.
-   On eating food, the snake grows and score increases.
-   Collision with boundary or itself ends the game.
